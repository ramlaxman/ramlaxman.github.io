# #Software Engineer #Software Development Engineer

Hi, This is Mayur S Patil. 

I am actively looking for Software Engineer or Software Development Engineer.

I have 4 years teaching Experience. 

These are following things on which I can work very easily:
Version Control (To make sense for useful code and reject nonsense code of brilliant developers)
Git : Windows, Linux command line, Git GUI, TortoiseGit
SVN : TortoiseSVN

Build Automation (To make brakers more active):
Jenkins




...

These dots mean more things on the way. Stay tuned.
